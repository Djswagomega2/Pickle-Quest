However, one day, a mighty hero, entrusted with a solid golden pickle from the sandwich gods from above, the uncondiments were quelled and sealed up in the substantial pickle cave protected by the ham-dragon. BUT YOUNG TRAVELER, the ham-dragon has become corrupt and threatens to take the golden pickle for himself, meaning the kingdom might be in great danger. You must get ready now if you want to go find the legendary pickle and save our kingdom, get ready for a pickle quest </p>
